# Technical challenge - Lodgify

## Prerequisites

1.Nodejs installed

## Installation

1. Clone the project with `git clone <REPO_URL>`
2. Run npm install to install the dependencies

## Running the tests

There are 3 test files: scenario1, scenario2, scenario3

To run a specific scenario use the scripts in package.json : `npm run <scenario>`

To run all the spec files use <`npm run runall`>

## Reporting

After each run, a mochawesome report will be generated in mochawesome-report folder inside the root of the project. Each report has the timestamp of the test run. To see the report, open the html file in your browser

If tests fail, the screenshotOnRunFailure option is enabled in cypress.config.js. Screenshots are saved under the cypress/screenshots folder
## Test data

User credentials should be stored in `cypress.env.json` . The file should be created before the test run. The format for credentials are `userMail` for email and `userPass` for password

All the test data can be found inside the files under the fixtures folder.
The data for each scenario such as project name, task name etc are autogenerated.
